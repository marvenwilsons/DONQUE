    Each admin is given a "resource"

What is "Resource"
 
    a resource is a list of section's, it is an array.
    each items in the array represents an item in the sidebar that can be seen after 
    logging in as an admin.

    A section is an object, so we can say a resource is an array of objects.
    each sections holds key a value pair, key is the name of the method that can be 
    invoked by the admin, the value is boolean, true or false, if the method name 
    has a value of true it means when the admin invoke's the method it will execute
    when it false, the cardinal system will return "Permission Denied"
