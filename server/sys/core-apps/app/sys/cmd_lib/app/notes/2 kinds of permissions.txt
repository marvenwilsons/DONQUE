Two ways of assigning permissions to an admin

1. the "general" way approach
    the general approach, is the kind of action you assign to an admin
    and that admin can perform that action on any section of the application.
    For example john is given a read and write permission, john can
    now perform read and write to pages, to components etc..

2. the "section" approach
    this type of approach is more secure and more flexible compared to the
    general approach, for example john is given a read and write permission
    to the page section, john can now perform read and write operations to 
    the pages section, but not on components, database etc.. john is only 
    bound to the section that is assigned to him.
