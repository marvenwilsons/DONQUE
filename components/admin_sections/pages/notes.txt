@page-notes : TODO : Transition Bug
    there is a transition bug, the context menu is still showing
    when transitioning to another pane, it should not be visible.

    also the stage array should be cleared when transitioning to another pane,
    before transition it should scan the page statge array if it there are unsave chagnes,
    there should be a modal that say, "unsaved changes detected" and 2 buttons 
    "discard changes and continue" "save changes"
